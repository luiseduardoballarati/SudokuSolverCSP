# SudokuSolverCSP
Sudoku Solver built in Python using Constraint Satisfaction Algorithm. This was a coursework for University of Bath Unit Artificial Intelligence. 

A sudoku is an n×n grid (normally n=9) with some numbers initially placed – these cannot be changed. The grid is broken down into sub-blocks of equal size. Solving the puzzle requires finding numbers from 1 to n such that each number appears exactly once in each row, column and sub-block or declaring that the sudoku is unsolvable.

In this assignment, I had to implement an AI solver of 9×9 sudoku puzzles using a search algorithm that I have seen in the unit so far (or any other method I deemed suitable).

I chose the constraint satisfaction.
